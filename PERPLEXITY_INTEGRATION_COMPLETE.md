### 🔍 How to Verify It's Working

1. **Check Browser Console**: Look for "✅ Perplexity AI client initialized successfully"
2. **Run a Session**: Generate a board and start analysis
3. **Check Reports**: Look for more specific, current market data in:
   - ICP Profile Report
   - Persona Breakdowns
   - Main Analysis Report

### 📝 Next Steps

1. **Restart Dev Server**: 
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test the Integration**:
   - Create a new board session
   - Check browser console for Perplexity initialization message
   - Review generated reports for enhanced research data

### ⚠️ Troubleshooting

If you see warnings in the console:
- ✅ "Perplexity AI client initialized successfully" = Working!
- ⚠️ "Perplexity API key not found" = Check `.env` file
- ⚠️ "Perplexity package not available" = Run `npm install @perplexity-ai/perplexity_ai`

The app will gracefully fall back to Gemini-only research if Perplexity fails, so it will always work!

### 🎯 Expected Results

With Perplexity enabled, you should see:
- More current market data and statistics
- Specific competitor insights and positioning
- Recent industry trends and developments
- Role-specific challenges and priorities
- Market language insights from SEO keywords
- Company size/revenue-specific behaviors

All of this research is automatically integrated into:
- Board member generation
- ICP Profile reports
- Persona breakdowns
- Main analysis reports
